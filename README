Long story short, this is a rewrite in Java of a software written in 1985 by my beloved dad to teach me the days of the week.
Original version was running on an Osborne computer (these were the days).

This version features for now a raw command line interface, 2 languages (French and English) and in addition to the days of the week, the months of the year, for good measure !
